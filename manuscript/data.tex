\section{Online Census}

The advent of mobile sensing techniques makes it possible to develop urban geography from social media source. Complementary to the conventional census, social media brings the benefit of larger sampling frequency and higher disaggregate in terms of space and time. It is possible to reach a wide range of individuals and collect the movement in human inactive time, such as the mid-night.

In this work, we perform the census survey in Shenzhen, which is one of the most modern metropolis in China. The experiment is deployed on Wechat, a widely used social media application. Figure~\ref{fig:app} shows the data collecting interfaces. Each individual hands in his or her personal characteristics. For privacy issue, all detailed personal information are desensitized to categorical levels (Figure~\ref{fig:app}(a)). 


\textbf{Individual Characteristics} Figure~\ref{fig:data_over} lists the \textit{eight domains}, including social, economic and deomgraphic aspects, to give a generalized description of the individual characteristics. The profile will serve as the ingredients for the analysis of mobility patterns over diverse individuals.

\end{figure}

\textbf{Traveling Trips} Besides to those individual characteristics, each individual can upload dynamic traveling trips (Figure~\ref{fig:app}(b)). Each trip requires the information of \textit{start/end location}, \textit{start/end time}, \textit{traveling purpose}. 

To encourage the trip uploading, a credit system retains the contribution of individuals on trips and rewards the volunteers with the top credits (Figure~\ref{fig:app}(c)). 


\subsection{Basic Statistics of Data}

Over the releasing time period from \m{2016-11 to 2018-01}, 21435 individules (48\% females and 52\% males) were reached and \m{229155} trips are collected. The majority of our 25481 volunteers contribute \m{11} trips averagly. 

Our case-study data is confined to a small proportion of Wechat users who opt to contribute their information and trips.
Considering the caveat that self-selecting individuals are most unlikely to represent any clearly defined population~\cite{Longley2015}, we performed a series of preliminary statistics to check whether it is rich enough to represent a wide range of individuals in the city. 

Figure~\ref{fig:data_age_edu} gives the distribution of age and education over the population. It shows that samples cover a wide range of all ages, dominately between 18 to 45. There is also a few records pertaining to individuals below the age of 18 or above 70. The distribution follows the fact that Shenzhen is a city where the majority is young people. According to the 2015 Annual Census Statistics report\footnote{http://www.sztj.gov.cn/xxgk/tjsj/pcgb/201606/t20160614\_3697000.htm}, people aging 15-64 occupy 83.23\% and the median age is 31.5. Figure~\ref{fig:data_age_edu} gives the distribution of education levels, ranging from low to high. The technical college and university dominates the education at the 61\% occupancy rate. 

% In the report (looking for some report), the penetration of mobile device is \m{XXX}, almost every XX people got a Mobile Phone in the urban.

Figure~\ref{fig:data_job_inc}(a) shows the job types of sampled individuals, who are servants, workers, officers, bussinessmen. The covering of jobs is pretty wide. Figure~\ref{fig:data_job_inc}(b) gives the radar diagram of the annual pay. The majority get paid below 200 000. Some individuals with higher salary are also reached in our census.

Figure~\ref{fig:data_geometry} shows the basic statistics related to trips. In Figure~\ref{fig:data_geometry}(a), the active traveling time (here, we take the start time as the representative of active time) follows the common sense of urban life. There are obvious morning and late afternoon peaks. Figure~\ref{fig:data_geometry}(b) gives the counting of different traveling purposes. 95\% trips are tagged with traveling purpose in the data. 33\% are going home and 37\% are going to work. Besides this kind of routine traveling, there are also substantial trips such as going shopping, going hospital, etc. Figure~\ref{fig:data_geometry}(c) shows the spatial distribution of the origins and destinations spot. It is found that more trips uploaded by volunteers located in Futian and Nanshan districts, the city's heart part of than the surrounding outer areas. This is consistent to Batty's exposition of the focus of city networks and interaction patterns~\cite{batty2013new}. 

% Trips are uploaded in a wide range of purpose in addition to home, work, but also includes XX entertainment, visiting, etc. The diverse purposes make it possible to characterize the flows across the city between different functional places.

Because there is always unevitable bias inherent in fully representing the ground true of society awide, the prelimeary statistical analysis shows positive sign of a relatively even sampling of the population.
