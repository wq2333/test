%% Abstract section.
\abstract{A city is shaped not only by its natural geographic landscape but also by social accessiblity to various citizens. In this work, via a social wide census investigation via the social media platform, citizens with various demographics are reached. We propose a visual analytics system to provide an intuitive perception of the accessiblity and activity, i.e., the kind of city folding phenomenon, in the context of various levels of social attributes (e.g., income, education, etc). Accompanied with temporal and spatial multiple views, the method is capable to reveal the detail of levels.%

In many work, anonymous movement data reveal the overall travel behaviour without social characteristics... Urban infrastructure centered, roads, regions are studied. Peopole centered, most related work is social media based, By considering people as the mobile sensor, about certain topics/keywords it is also an indirect way. 

Because social characteristics is private that not easy to get. (Emphasize how special our research is). We conduct an online demographical colleciton campaign based on famouse social medial platform. With the wide-use of mobile device. Collecting data via a widely used social medial platform, users (what the right word here?) with various profiles are reached and assembled as rich (and fair?) demographic data. (what we are going to do)

% In this work, we propose to enhance static charts with kinetic effects, which serve as an plausible and orthogonal extension of conventional static visual cuing. Three kinetic effects (marching ants, geometry deformation and blinking) are introduced to demonstrate the idea from dynamic effects of motion, deformation and on-off repeating patterns. Kinetic effects encode various messages by design dimensions via the data driven mechanism. ...  kinetic effects brings the unsaid or less-notified information and bring the static infographics and charts to life. A controlled user study ...%Aligned with daily life experience , charts  enhanced by Kinetic Effect provides 
% which maintains the richness of expressibility .
