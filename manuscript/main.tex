\abstract{A city is shaped not only by its assembled infrastructures but also the population living inside it. Population in a wide range of individual characteristics visit places with different weights and preferences, sculpturing the city into a space of diverse mobility patterns. Different from the well study of anonymous travel behaviours, the mobility patterns of characterized individuals, is less studied because of the challenges in collection and analysis of data with privacy. In this work, we take a step forward and carefully perform an online census to collect individual profiles and movements from large-scale volunteers. Then we develop a visual analytic system to investigate the mobility patterns of groups by specifying characteristics. To facilitate the identification of characterized groups, individuals are embedded in t-SNE projection for abstract overview as well as drawn as vivid graphics by a data-driven profile method for detail examination. A 2.5D spatial visualization is proposed to maintain a compact multivariable analysis by relaxing the z-axis to encode information incorporating visiting frequency, demands, traveling distance, etc. Together with the cross-filter and flexible 2.5D interactions, the effectiveness and usability of the system is well demonstrated by a study made in Shenzhen.}

\section{Introduction}

The science fiction \textit{Folding Beijing}~\cite{hao2016_foldingbeijing} depicts a world where three classes of people live by independent spatial-temporal patterns, while sharing the same earth surface. This is an artistical metaphor for one potential fact in reality that people make different choices of visiting places by individual determinants, such as social, economic, educational factors, etc. This has attracted the research interest for a long time in sociological field. Back to 1970, Pahl~\cite{pahl1975whose} posed the question `whose city` and interest in understanding the territorial inequalities. Contemporal contestation also continuely raries the banner `The City Belongs to All!'~\cite{Mayer2017_whosecity}. Having a good understanding of how the mobility patterns relates to characterisized individuals sheds light on region utilization, diversity mix-up and opportunities promotion. 

In the past decades, the power of visual analytics in exploring spatial-temporal data has been regcognized and well developped. Transportation problems are analyzed in various movement data, such as traffic jams in taxi GPS trajectoires~\cite{wang2013visual}, interchanging flows in public transportation~\cite{zeng2013visualizing}, etc. The presence of social media applications fuels the spatial analysis with rich semantic texts, so researchers get the chances to explore thematic meaning of the moving behaivour, such as events~\cite{chen2017map} or topics~\cite{bosch2013scatterblogs2}. Those works essentially contribute in deepening the contextual understanding of moving activity, but rarely combine the mobility with individuals' characteristics which can not be 100\% inferred from social media profiles. There is still a research gap to reach a conclusion for relationship between mobility pattern and movers' characteristics. 


In this work, we contextualize the analysis of mobility pattern in the backcloth of individual charateristics. Our motivation is to fuse the movement data with individuals' profiles in an attempt to ascentain the dynamics pattern of groups with different scharacteristics. To this, we need to get the characterized information of movers. One of the main challenges is the sensitivity issue in privacy data. Conventional census data is often decennial census for the nation wide because it takes lots of effort. With the wide-use of mobile device, it is possible to count information online, however, there are two measurements to be varified, one is how to deal with the willingness in uploading sensitive dataset and the other is how to ensure the even sampling. With a census survey released via social media application, we ran an online demographical colleciton campaign. Then we propose a visual analytics system to explore the mobility patterns centered around people. The ssytem incorporates visualizations of movers' characteristics, including t-SNE for overview and data-driven profile visualization for detailed check, as well as 2.5D spatial visualization to explore the mobility patterns. Finally, appling our method in Shenzhen, several cases are derived to demonstrate the powerness of our method. There are two contributions of this work: 

(1) investigate mobility patterns with characteristics, which is  natural steps into research of social understanding of the city. 

(2) develop a visual analytic system for a 2.5D spatial visualization and analytic system, which contributes in exploring  the potential of 2.5D in visual analytics.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Combined travel demands, this work illustrates the relationship between accessibility and behaviour within the region, which in turn can be used to forecast the traveling trips. 

derive zonal level analysis thich can be used in transportation applications.

Our analysis demonstrates how demographics survey collectd via social media have the potential to indiate the movement patterns of groups that have different social charactersitics and the difference in using urban facilities. Better understand of the interactions between population characteristics and their urban activity. The data we used represent a small propotion of the population of which we do not have the clear definition of its demographics. We consider this work as one of the first steps of research contextualize the analysis of urban dynamcis with social science, to understand the  interactions between population characteristics and their urban activity.
