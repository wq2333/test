%% Abstract section.
\abstract{A city is shaped not only by its natural geographic landscape but also by social accessiblity to various citizens. In this work, via a social wide census investigation via the social media platform, citizens with various demographics are reached. We propose a map distortion method to provide an intuitive perception of the accessiblity, i.e., the kind of city folding phenomenon, in the context of various levels of social attributes (e.g., income, education, etc). Accompanied with temporal and spatial multiple views, the method is capabile to reveal the detail of levels.

For centuries, knowledge sharing and exchange of ideas have relied upon the usage of visual charts and diagrams designed to be viewed in hard-copy form.
To emphasize and draw attention to certain aspects of the data, static cues like color and geometric shapes were utilized with great success.
Nowadays, digital displays are ubiquitous in the visualization of any form of data, lifting the confines of static presentations.
In this work, we propose taking a natural step forward, and incorporate data-driven dynamic enhancements into otherwise static visualization schemes, for the purpose of element emphasis and attention guidance. 
Given a chart or a diagram, and their underlying data, we perform a simple analysis to determine elements and attributes of importance. According to their characteristics, a suitable dynamic effect is applied directly onto the displayed data, creating an illusion of a visualization brought to life.
We experiment with three versatile effects, namely, \textit{marching ants}, \textit{geometry deformation} and \textit{blinking}, and provide practical details regarding their mode of operation and extent of interaction with existing visual channels.
We examine the impact and effectiveness of our enhancements via two user studies designed to assess personal preference as well as gauge the influence of visual dynamic effects on human perception in terms of fast, yet accurate visual understanding. 

Complementary to conventional visual channels such as color, shape, in this work, we propose to enhance the static charts with activating visual channel, i.e., animation effect, to bring life to visualization. The usage of animation effect enhancement is instantiated in different data types, including graph, tree, spatial, temporal, etc. A user study reports its effectiveness.

% In this work, we propose to enhance static charts with kinetic effects, which serve as an plausible and orthogonal extension of conventional static visual cuing. Three kinetic effects (marching ants, geometry deformation and blinking) are introduced to demonstrate the idea from dynamic effects of motion, deformation and on-off repeating patterns. Kinetic effects encode various messages by design dimensions via the data driven mechanism. ...  kinetic effects brings the unsaid or less-notified information and bring the static infographics and charts to life. A controlled user study ...%Aligned with daily life experience , charts  enhanced by Kinetic Effect provides 
% which maintains the richness of expressibility .
