\abstract{A city is shaped not only by its assembled infrastructures but also the people living inside it. People in a wide range of individual characteristics visit places with different weights and preferences, sculpturing the city into a space of diverse mobility patterns. Different from the well study of anonymous travel behaviors, the mobility patterns of characterized individuals, is less studied because of the challenges in collection and analysis of data with privacy. In this work, we take a step forward and perform an online census to collect individual profiles and movements from large-scale volunteers. Then we develop a visual analytic system to investigate the mobility patterns of groups by specifying characteristics. To facilitate the identification of characterized groups, individuals are embedded in t-SNE projection for an abstract overview as well as drawn as vivid graphics by a data-driven profile method for detail examination. A 2.5D spatial visualization is proposed to maintain a compact multivariable analysis by relaxing the z-axis to encode information, such as visiting frequency, demands, traveling distance, etc. Together with the cross-filter and flexible 2.5D interactions, the effectiveness and usability of the system are well demonstrated by a study made in Shenzhen.}

\section{Introduction}
The science fiction \textit{Folding Beijing}~\cite{hao2016_foldingbeijing} depicts a world where three classes of people live in independent spatial-temporal patterns, though sharing the same earth surface. This is an artistical metaphor for one potential fact that people make different decisions in visiting places according to individual determinants, such as social, economic, educational factors, etc. This phenomenon has attracted the research interest for a long time in the sociological field. Back to 1970, Pahl~\cite{pahl1975whose} posed the question `whose city` and interest in understanding the territorial inequalities. Contemporary contestation also continually raise the banner `The City Belongs to All!'~\cite{Mayer2017_whosecity}. Having a good understanding of how the mobility patterns relate to characterized individuals sheds light on region utilization, diversity mix-up, and opportunities promotion. 

In the past decades, the power of visual analytics in exploring spatial-temporal data has been recognized and well developed. Transportation problems are answered by various movement data, such as traffic jams in taxi GPS trajectoires~\cite{wang2013visual}, interchanging flows in public transportation~\cite{zeng2013visualizing}, etc. The presence of social media applications fuels the spatial analysis with rich semantic texts, so researchers get the chances to explore the thematic meaning of the moving behavior, such as events~\cite{chen2017map} or topics~\cite{bosch2013scatterblogs2}. Those works essentially contribute in deepening the contextual understanding of moving activity. But they rarely combine the mobility with individuals' characteristics because which cannot be 100\% inferred from social media profiles. There is still a research gap in exploring the relationship between mobility pattern and characteristics. 


In this work, we contextualize the analysis of mobility pattern in the backcloth of individual characteristics. Our motivation is to fuse the movement data with individuals' profiles in an attempt to ascertain the dynamics pattern of groups with different characteristics. To this, we need to get the characterized information of movers. The sensitivity issue in privacy data is one of the main challenges. The conventional offline census takes lots of effort and too much time to be out of date. With the wide use of the mobile device, it is possible to count information online. In this work, with a census survey released via social media application, we ran an online demographical collection campaign. Then we developed a visual analytics system to explore the mobility patterns centered around people. The system incorporates visualizations of individuals' characteristics, including t-SNE for an overview and data-driven profile visualization for the detailed check, as well as 2.5D spatial visualization to explore the mobility patterns. Finally, applying our method in Shenzhen, several cases are derived to demonstrate the powers of our method. There are two contributions of this work: 

(1) investigate mobility patterns with characteristics, which is a natural step into research of social understanding of the city. 

(2) develop a visual analytic system, whose effectiveness and usability is well demonstrated by a study made in Shenzhen.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This work demonstrates a throughout research flow from data collection, basic analysis to deep visual analysis of mobility patterns with individual characteristics. Considering the irresistible trend in mixing social data and spatial data to solve the urban problem, this work takes one step forward in exploring the relationship between movement and individuals' characteristics, which is rarely touched by previous geo-tagged social media visual analytics. The design of the visual analytic system is driven by three tasks about individuals and mobility patterns. Tapping into our daily experiences, the data-driven profile visualization provides an organic and intuitive representation of individuals. Its effectiveness in identifying similar or abnormal individuals from the mass has been demonstrated. The design of 2.5D spatial visualization continues the exploration of the typical research problem how to visualize spatial information and abstract information together. Although it is not a one-step solution, 2.5D visualization with the detail slicing is able to provide an occlusion-free analysis with spatial context preserved. 

Our current research focuses on fundamental facets of the mobility patterns and doesn't draw a strong conclusion on the correlation between mobility pattern and individual characteristics. In next step, more delicate algorithms will be involved to extract high-level mobility patterns, such as the frequent visiting sequence of an individual group, etc. On the other hand, the data we used in this work shows its potential in representing the population. As the next step, research effort can be put into a more serious verification of how small sampled data can represent a large population.

%efforts we consider this work as one of the first steps of research contextualize the analysis of urban dynamcis with social science, to understand the  interactions between population characteristics and their urban activity. 


% Combined travel demands, this work illustrates the relationship between accessibility and behaviour within the region, which in turn can be used to forecast the traveling trips. 

% derive zonal level analysis thich can be used in transportation applications.

% Our analysis demonstrates how demographics survey collectd via social media have the potential to indiate the movement patterns of groups that have different social charactersitics and the difference in using urban facilities. Better understand of the interactions between population characteristics and their urban activity.
